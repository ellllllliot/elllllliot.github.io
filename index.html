                <a href="https://grizzled-deciduous-egret.glitch.me/" title="a dadaist poem: this was my first piece and so, I used it to learn how to make a few simple adjustments such as changing fonts, text, colour and margins. I also altered the text to instead use the lyrics from Cage the Elephant's 'Come a Little Closer', my favourite song!" target="_blank" style="color: #c8a951"><i>to make a dadaist poem</i></a> 
                <a href="https://kindhearted-watery-neem.glitch.me/" title="n-45: this was my 2nd piece, and is where I further practiced toying with the colours, fonts, and text alignment, as well as the noun offset function that makes an n+7 such. I opted to utilise a recent speech by Donald Trump, simply exaggerate the idea that his speeches are a bunch of senseless drivel. All in the nationalist spirit, I guess." target="_blank" style="color: #c8a951"><i>n-45</i></a>
                <a href="https://power-blush-grouse.glitch.me/" title="midnight floats to her: probably my favourite piece on here. it's a self-generating poem where I toyed with the generating functions as well as the other things mentioned before. I thought it would be interesting to implement a slew of words as well as capitalisations in order to enhance the sheer randomness of the sentences, the idea that the subject of each sentence can build new contexts and relationships with one another every time." target="_blank" style="color: #c8a951"><i>midnight floats to her</i></a>
